# unofficial .gitignore for WWise + Unity projects
# dom at audiotankstudios dot com for questions
# 
# this is based on a slightly older Unity and WWise version but, should be a decent starting point
#
# Instructions:
# 1) Place this in your root folder for your Unity project
# 2) Modify "WWiseProject/" below to be the path to your .wproj folder inside your Unity assets

# Unity portion based on https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Unity.gitignore

# 1) if any other files go in Assets/Wwise/Editor/ProjectData/ besides AkWwiseProjectData.asset*,

#    then, it's OK to ignore this file.
